P-19-04445,"LIKELIHOOD OF RESPONSE BASED ON EVIDENCE IN CURRENT LITERATURE: From an immunotherapy perspective, the positive PD-L1 expression (75% immune cells staining) in this presumed TNBC makes this patient eligible for atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel. FDA approval was based on results from the phase 3 IMpassion130 clinical trial, which compared atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel as the initial, or first-line, treatment for patients with triple-negative breast cancer. The trial included 902 patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy for metastatic disease. Among the 369 patients in the trial with PD-L1â€“positive tumors, the median progression-free survival was 7.4 months for patients treated with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and 4.8 months for those who received placebo plus chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 53% in the atezolizumab group versus 33% for the placebo group. This case meets the criteria of a positive PD-L1 by IHC and has greater than 1% staining in TILs. These results would support a favorable response to atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel for this patient. Response to PD-1 axis inhibition in this patient is favorable based on the strong PD-L1 expression. 

MOLECULAR SUMMARY: This TP53 mutant triple-negative breast cancer with an intermediate mutational burden is moderately inflamed with a moderate number of CD8+ T-cells, and strong expression of PD-L1 by IHC (75% IC; SP142 clone).

MOLECULAR SUMMARY: DNA-seq for targeted therapy, TMB, and MSI could not be completed, limiting the overall evaluation of this tumor. Components of this test that could be completed were RNA-seq immune profiling and fusion analysis. This non-small cell lung cancer is highly inflamed with a high number of CD8+ T-cells, high macrophage content RNA-seq immune profiling analysis shows a significant PD-1 axis immune checkpoint blockade with moderately high to high expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2, which is reflective of the highly inflamed state. Other evidence of T-cell exhaustion in this tumor is over expression of alternative checkpoint blockade (LAG3, VISTA) and co-stimulatory T-cell signaling (CD137, CD27, CD40, GITR, ICOS, OX40). This tumor shows evidence of metabolic suppression with over expression of ADORA2A and CD39 and myeloid suppression with over expression of CCL2, IDO1, and TGFB1.

P-19-04394,"LIKELIHOOD OF RESPONSE BASED ON EVIDENCE IN CURRENT LITERATURE: From an immunotherapy perspective, the positive PD-L1 expression (60% immune cells staining) in this TNBC makes this patient eligible for atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel. FDA approval was based on results from the phase 3 IMpassion130 clinical trial, which compared atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel as the initial, or first-line, treatment for patients with triple-negative breast cancer. The trial included 902 patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy for metastatic disease. Among the 369 patients in the trial with PD-L1â€“positive tumors, the median progression-free survival was 7.4 months for patients treated with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and 4.8 months for those who received placebo plus chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 53% in the atezolizumab group versus 33% for the placebo group. This case meets the criteria of a positive PD-L1 by IHC and has greater than 1% staining in TILs. These results would support a favorable response to atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel for this patient.

P-19-04221,"LIKELIHOOD OF RESPONSE BASED ON EVIDENCE IN CURRENT LITERATURE: DNA-seq for targeted therapy failed for this case. RNA-seq for fusion analysis was successful but negative for ALK, ROS1, RET, NTRK, and other fusions. There were no clinically actionable fusions detected for this case.

From an immunotherapy perspective, response to PD-1 axis inhibition in this patient is not favorable. Recommendation is augmentation of a PD-1 axis checkpoint inhibitor with chemotherapy and/or radiation.

MOLECULAR SUMMARY: DNA-seq for targeted therapy, TMB, and MSI could not be completed, limiting the overall evaluation of this tumor. Components of this test that could be completed were IHC for PD-L1, RNA-seq immune profiling, and fusion analysis. This prostate cancer is moderately inflamed with a moderate number of CD8+ T-cells, a moderate number of CD4+FOXP3+ T-cells, high macrophage content, and less than 5% expression of PD-L1 by IHC (1%; 22C3 clone). RNA-seq immune profiling analysis for PD-L1 shows a low level of expression. There is evidence of T-cell exhaustion in this tumor with over expression of co-stimulatory T-cell signaling (CD27). This tumor shows evidence of metabolic suppression with over expression of ADORA2A and CD39 and myeloid suppression with over expression of CCR2 and TGFB1.

P-19-04026,"LIKELIHOOD OF RESPONSE BASED ON EVIDENCE IN CURRENT LITERATURE: From an immunotherapy perspective, the positive PD-L1 expression (1% immune cells staining) in this presumed TNBC makes this patient eligible for atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel. FDA approval was based on results from the phase 3 IMpassion130 clinical trial, which compared atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel as the initial, or first-line, treatment for patients with triple-negative breast cancer. The trial included 902 patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy for metastatic disease. Among the 369 patients in the trial with PD-L1â€“positive tumors, the median progression-free survival was 7.4 months for patients treated with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and 4.8 months for those who received placebo plus chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 53% in the atezolizumab group versus 33% for the placebo group. This case meets the criteria of a positive PD-L1 by IHC and has greater than 1% staining in TILs. These results would support a favorable response to atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel for this patient. Response to PD-1 axis inhibition in this patient is indeterminate, although there is some concern for the non-inflamed status . Recommendation is combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, or durvalumab and tremelimumab, augmentation of a PD-1 axis checkpoint inhibitor with chemotherapy and/or radiation, or agents that specifically improve TILs recruitment such as the mutant IL-2 drugs ALKS 4230 or mutant IL-15 ALT-803 (see clinical trials section of the report). It should be noted that preliminary results for the mutant IL-2 drugs NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab in a cohort of 36 melanoma, RCC or NSCLC reported at SITC 2017 showed reduction of tumor size in greater than 70% of subjects with an objective response of 92% in the melanoma cohort. In a phase 1b study of the IL-15 superagonist ALT-803 in combination with nivolumab wherein 21 patients enrolled to the trial, 11 of whom had previously received a single-agent PD-1 monoclonal antibody and progressed after at least 3 months of treatment (PMID: 29628312), the proportion of anti-PD-1 treatment-resistant patients who achieved disease control was 91% (ten of 11 patients), with three (27%) partial responses and seven (64%) patients with stable disease. To the best of my knowledge human clinical studies for ALKS 4230 have not been reported.

MOLECULAR SUMMARY: This CDH1/CDKN2A/ERBB2/TP53/TSC1 mutant triple-negative breast cancer with loss of APC and PIK3R1 and a high mutational burden is non-inflamed with a low number of CD8+ T-cells, relatively high type 2 macrophage content, and modest expression of PD-L1 by IHC (1% IC; SP142 clone).

The FDA has recently granted accelerated approval to the combination of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) and have disease progression following prior systematic therapy but are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. Results from the Phase 1b/2 Study 111/KEYNOTE-146 trial (NCT02501096) showed an ORR of 38.3% with a 10.6% complete response rate and 27.7% partial response rate. It is unknown if this patient is mismatch repair deficient. 

MOLECULAR SUMMARY: This microsatellite stable TP53 mutant endometrial cancer with a low mutational burden is moderately inflamed with a moderate number of CD8+ T-cells, a moderate number of CD4+FOXP3+ T-cells, relatively high type 2 macrophage content, and negative expression of PD-L1 by IHC (TPS=0%; 22C3 clone), although there is frequent staining in immune cells.
